# Gun-Analysis

This is an analysis of two rifles, where the first column of data represents the lengths of the barrel of each respetive rifle.
 The second and third column are the pressures at each data point. So to fully implement the kinemiatic equations to run the analysis, we need to 
use techniques in numerical integration and differentiation to get velocities and accelerations. The user has full control of the analysis; ranging from the 
description of the rifle, ability to change the data set (more robust code to be updated to accomodate any data set), and the angle shot. The user has a choice
of output: either the output be displayed on the screen or can be transferred to a text file.
